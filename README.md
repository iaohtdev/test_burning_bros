# Infinite Scrolling and Searchable Product List

This is a Flutter application that allows users to view, search, and manage a list of products. The app features product fetching with infinite scrolling, search functionality, and a favorites system. The app is built using Clean Architecture, BLoC/Cubit state management, and Hive for local storage.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Fetch and display a list of products with infinite scrolling.
- **Search**: Search for products by query with instant results.
- **Favorites**: Add and remove products from favorites. View all favorite products in a separate screen.
- **Network Checking**: Handle no internet connection scenarios with appropriate error messages.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture

The project is structured using Clean Architecture principles:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI and state management logic using Flutter's BLoC/Cubit.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Handles data sources (remote and local) and repository implementations.

### State Management

State management is handled using Flutter's Cubit. The `ProductCubit` manages the state for fetching and searching products, while the `FavoriteCubit` handles the state for managing favorite products.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iaohtdev/test_burning_bros.git
    cd product-management-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Usage

### Fetching Products

Products are fetched and displayed with infinite scrolling. Use the `ProductCubit` to handle fetching and searching products.

### Search Products

Use the `searchProducts` method in `ProductCubit` to search for products based on user input.

### Manage Favorites

Add and remove products from favorites using the `FavoriteCubit`. The favorites are stored locally using Hive and can be viewed in the Favorites screen.

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Display toast messages when there is no internet connection.
- **Fetch Errors**: Show error messages in the UI if product fetching fails.

## Example

```dart
// Fetch products
context.read<ProductCubit>().fetchProducts();

// Search products
context.read<ProductCubit>().searchProducts('query');

// Add to favorites
context.read<FavoriteCubit>().addFavorite(product);

// Remove from favorites
context.read<FavoriteCubit>().removeFavorite(productId);
